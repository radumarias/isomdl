# Connection and data exchange between a device and a reader

```bash
 cargo run --package isomdl_examples --bin simulated_device_and_reader
```

This example demonstrates a simulated device and reader interaction.  
The reader requests the `age_over_21` element, and the device responds with that value.
The flow is as follows:

1. **Device initialization and engagement:**
    - The device creates a QR code containing `DeviceEngagement` data, which includes its public key.
    - Internally:
        - The device initializes with the mDL data, private key, and public key.
2. **Reader processing QR and requesting needed fields:**
    - The reader processes the QR code and creates a request for the `age_over_21` element.
    - Internally:
        - Generates its private and public keys.
        - Initiates a key exchange, and generates the session keys.
        - The request is encrypted with the reader's session key.
3. **Device accepting request and responding:**
    - The device receives the request and creates a response with the `age_over_21` element.
    - Internally:
        - Initiates the key exchange, and generates the session keys.
        - Decrypts the request with the reader's session key.
        - Parse and validate it creating error response if needed.
        - The response is encrypted with the device's session key.
4. **Reader Processing mDL data:**
    - The reader processes the response and prints the value of the `age_over_21` element.
